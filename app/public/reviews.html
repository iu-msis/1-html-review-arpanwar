                Now THIS is good!
I’m writing this as someone who’s read every Harry Potter and watched all the movies (yes, this includes Fantastic Beasts), and this is the best Harry Potter out of the whole lot in my opinion. Yes, it’d 800 pages and the longest, but take your time. It’s interesting. I’ll give fans who haven’t read this book a quick NON-SPOILER blurb:

As Voldemort has returned, the Wizarding World is in mortal danger... they just don’t know it yet. The Ministry of Magic is telling the world that Harry and Dumbledore are lying attention seeking idiots. But with Harry getting strange visions, Dumbledore enquires Professor  Severus Snape to train Harry a special section of magic to block it out, but danger is held along the way...

                This is such a good book. It is a bit long at 870 pages, but I loved every single page of this book. The way Harry feels is portrayed perfectly and the way Hermione studies frantically for her OWLs matches her character's personality so well. This book is so, so good, especially the battle in the Department of Mysteries, and I loved how Luna's character was added. Luna plays such an important role in this movie, explaining the thestrals and other things to Harry. Overall, it is a great book. I would give it ten stars.

            This book is AMAZING along with the other books. The plot is filled with excitement, and I can't put the book down. No matter how tired I am, I always stay up late reading this because I'm in the middle of a good part, but  EVERY PART is a GOOD part!!! 

            P.S. If you see a bad comment by Arthur Pidlaoan (my brother), Everything he wrote is false and he wrote that comment just to spite me. I totally recommend this book along with the rest of the series!

                Just like its predecessors , I loved this book. The scenes are written very vividly, the law is portrayed as strict and firm, and i have developed an indescribable hatred for Umbridge and I'm sure I will never be able to hate someone more than i hate Dolores Jane Umbridge. The book is beautiful and emotional. And i would be lying if i said that i didn't cry for days when the book ended. I felt my heart break at the ending. Nevertheless, this book is the best book I've read along with the others in the serious. I absolutely love it.
